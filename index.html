                <h4>From: Waverly J. Hanson MA, LPC</h4>
                <h4 class="mb-5">Let Me Tell You About Luke and Audrey…</h4>
                <div id="style-4">
                  <p>Recently, on just a normal day in my practice of working with
                    couples on their marriages, a desperate sounding call came in
                    from Luke, a young husband and father, wanting to make an
                    appointment as soon as possible to see if he could convince Audrey,
                  his wife, to stay as she was on her way out the door.</p>

                  <p>Unfortunately, this kind of call is not uncommon and in fact, much of
                    the time when husbands call it is because she is packing the car, has
                    already left or has threatened to leave if he does not make an
                    appointment for marriage help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though Luke was feeling desperate, I felt a lot of hope, as I
                    usually do, due to seeing so many other couples make dramatic
                    turnarounds in relatively short periods of time.
                    During this call, however, it was even better than usual
                    as Luke immediately took responsibility for his actions that had
                  led Audrey to no longer trust him.</p>

                  <p>​Luke had a big personal problem in his past but had been doing well
                    for several years. Audrey had not been part of that bad scene, and she
                    had made it clear from the beginning that those problems would never
                  be an option she would accept within their marriaged life.</p>

                  <p>Audrey had made this “vow” to herself long ago as she watched her
                    Dad with a big personal problem and her Mom choosing to ignore it
                    and pretend it was not happening. She had decided she would never
                    allow that or any other big personal problem to happen in her life and
                  had been quite vocal about it.</p>
                  <p>A few months ago, Luke had a very painful surgery and during that
                    period of time he gradually had changed to become very withdrawn
                    along with frequent very angry outbursts.  Both were happening
                  frequently.</p>
                  <p>Audrey was cautious but had brought up these changes and Luke
                    appeared to blow her off though secretly he also had concerns. He
                    continued to deny there was any problem and she continued to feel
                  there was.</p>
                  <p>Audrey was absolutely devastated when she somehow discovered
                    what Luke had done and faced him with her discovery due to his fear
                    of losing her, he unfortunately made the choice to deny what he had
                    done. To make matters even worse, this happened on at least two
                  different occasions.</p>
                  <p>When they came for their first appointment, it was clear
                    that Audrey was very skeptical as to whether or not this process could
                    help them work things out as she had lost her total trust in anything he
                  said.</p>
                  <p>
                    Without disclosing the details of all the repairs that were made, I am
                    so happy to share that within a few weeks, Luke and Audrey are now
                    back on track in their relationship while Luke is seriously back on his
                    recovery path that worked so well for him for years. Audrey, his wife,
                    who earlier did not want to identify with this problem is also getting
                    the support and education she needs so she understands how to be in a
                  healthy place for herself and the marriage.</p>
                  <p>One of the lessons, Luke learned through this very painful time in
                    their marriage, is that he must keep on the recovery path which was so
                    successful and meaningful to him earlier. During this stage of life with
                    being newly married, having two beautiful children along with a
                  highly successful business, he thought this was enough.</p>
                  <p>Luke’s recovery turned out to be the most important thing of all. He
                    has seriously re-committed to that now even though earlier he thought
                    he didn’t need it anymore. He learned that he would lose all that
                  means everything to him without it.</p>
                  <p>Audrey, his wife, who is also very committed to their marriage and
                    family is now willing to join in with some other friends and family
                    members who find they keep healthy by being in supportive healthy
                    groups and also taking good care of herself.She is realizing she can
                    also benefit, especially with her earlier background also instead of
                  denying it.</p>
                  <p>Both have learned some great lessons through this painful time.
                    Always being honest and trustworthy with one another is probably one
                    of the very biggest lessons. Luke laughingly teases (sort of)
                    that Audrey being a part of those ladies will really make him stay on
                    the “straight and narrow.”
                  </p>
                  <p>Regularly, I get to witness struggling couples reconnect, feel loved
                    and close to one another again. The story really makes me feel happy
                    and excited to help more couples out there.
                  </p>
                  <p>This fuels my passion for serving and finding ways to reach out
                  my helping hand to YOU.</p>

                <p>There was a lot of sleeping on the couch and in the spare bedroom.</p>
                <p>They were constantly battling over the smallest issue — which only led to bigger
                issues. Threats and yelling were an almost everyday thing.</p>
                <p>They both desperately wanted to be accepted and loved, but neither felt it.
                The more each tried, it seemed the further they moved apart.</p>
                <p>They had tried therapy, self-help books, seminars.
                But nothing seemed to make a difference.</p>
                <p>It seemed as if they were stuck in a vicious cycle.
                  They knew they needed to change things in their relationship…
                but they just didn’t know how.</p>
                <p>I’m not going to try and convince you that I was able to undo years of fighting,
                  struggling and disappointment in a day. But, with what they learned in my office
                that day, they decided to put their impending divorce “on hold.”</p>

          <h2>Anyone Is Capable Of Transforming Their Relationship</h2>
          <p>Impossible as it may seem, I have created techniques which transform relationships… even when only one
            person is trying! My typical client is a spouse that wants to save their relationship when their partner
            has
            already “given up.”Most therapists work from the assumption that, if only one person wanted to work on
            the
            relationship, it was impossible to fix. I don’t approach marriage crises this way. I approach them like
            an
            algebra equation. If one side of the equation is changed, the other side must change! Incredibly, my
            clients
            have achieved an 89.7% success rate. . . even if only one spouse starts the process! (Findings based on
          surveys. Individual results can vary.)</p>
          <p>With Kelly and Greg, it was Kelly who started the process. She found me on the internet , started the Marriage Miracle course and began the process of saving the marriage. . . by herself. Greg was still bent on a
            divorce,
            but Kelly still had hope. . . and took action. Fairly quickly, Greg was less insistent on the divorce,
            but
            still assumed it was their only option. Eventually, he agreed to spend that hour with me, in person. . .
          leaving their divorce attorneys waiting.</p>
          <p>You may be wondering. . .“When Is Saving The Marriage Impossible?”</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, the “not knowing how” has been translated into “not caring” by the dissatisfied partner
          and seems to provide proof (for someone looking for proof) that the marriage is over.</p>
          <p>More marriages die from neglect than anything else. Often, it is simply a matter of life getting in the
            way. Strangely,
            something as important as marriage gets ignored. More than that, the relationship shifts from suffering
            with neglect to
          a growing animosity and antipathy.</p>
          <p>On their wedding day, no one expects their marriage to fail.</p>
          <p>And when people rate their life priorities, their marital relationship always ranks in the top 3 or 4.

          day</span> talking about issues that do not
        include schedules and the kids. Does that sound about right to you?</p>
        <p>As neglect sets in, this lack of attention eats away at the relationship, slowly eroding the capacity of
          the couple to
        form a substantial relationship.</p>
        <p>From there, disconnection opens the potential for affairs and other marriage crises. Eventually, someone
          is convinced
        that the marriage has come to the end.</p>

          <p>No marriage crisis appears overnight.</p>
          <p>Rather, the crisis builds slowly over time. One person is, usually, caught completely off-guard. . . not

          with no change. . . and has “given up.”</p>
          <p>You see, the real damage is done when one person needs and expects something to change, but the other
            person is preserving the exact same things the spouse wants to change. For example, there is often a
            desire for a shift in the power structure of the relationship, but one person resists making any change.
          The other person who wants the change becomes more and more frustrated.</p>

                  <p>My wife already filed for divorce before I downloaded you book, and i wanted to do anything I could to
                    save what I could. At that stage I stumbled onto your website, and normally I don’t buy e-books over the
                  internet.</p>
                  <p>We were speaking, but obviously the relationship was very tense. After reading your book I realized
                    what
                  could have gone wrong.</p>
                  <p>I changed my perspective on my marriage, and after only about 1 week, she has delayed the proceedings,
                    and is seriously reconsidering the divorce completely. She is also starting to commit to this marriage.
                  </p>
                  <p>If this can happen in my marriage in only 1 week, i can only imagine what it van mean to others. It was
                  worth every penny.</p>
                  <p>Again, thank you very much for the information you provided. I opened my eyes to what marriage is
